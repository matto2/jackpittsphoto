    A fair percentage of my art photography can be considered somewhat atypical.
    It’s my father’s fault. When I was about 10, he somehow wound up with a 3-D
    camera that produced outrageously vibrant, stunningly beautiful 35mm color
    slides that we looked at thru a brightly lit Kodak hand-held stereo viewer.
    This didn’t turn me into a color photographer necessarily, but I’m convinced
    that all that unusual exposure (ahem) ultimately awakened some kind of
    non-conformist gene. It may be what’s led toward an attraction to what is
    not automatically obvious or readily imaginable as a potentially beautiful
    and/or compelling art photo. Thanks, Dad.
